This document tries to describe the specification
for a constellation segment as drawn by the game player

Class Segement:
    def __init__(star1):

        self.star1 = star1

    def add_star2(star2):
        self.star2 = star2

    def update(dt):
        probably nothing to do here


    def draw(screen)
        draw a line between star 1 and 2



Another element to specify is the rubber band.
I would not confuse a rubber band with the segment.
A rubber band is the case where the player has selected
a first star by clicking it with the press of a click.
The rubber band is active as long as the click does not
release.

This class only exists as a single entity, not multiple of these.
So it could actually be easily written into the gameplay logic.
    

class Rubber_Band:
    def __init__(star1):
        self.star1 = star1

    def update(dt):
        pass

    def event(event)
        if button_up:
            cancel
        elif new position
            position2 = event.pos

    def draw(screen)
        draw a line between star1 and position2
