To handle different screen resolutions I think we may need to scale images properly
While pygame does some of this scaling using pygame.SCALED, I don't think it will 
change an image I blit to the screen.  While SCALED will do some automatic scaling,
this applies to scaling UP to a higher resolution.  But won't fixe scaling down to
a lower resolution.

For scaling down, when loading levels, we need to scale images and coords consistently.
Then if we are saving levels, we scale back up to the full (max) resolution of our game.

Then we can try scaling up on an even high resolution display like my laptop.
